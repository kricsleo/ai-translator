# Translator driven by AI

I really like [openai-translator](https://github.com/openai-translator/openai-translator), but unfortunately, it's not being actively maintained anymore. The author, [yetone](https://x.com/yetone), has put it aside due to [the difficult task of upgrading Tauri](https://x.com/yetone/status/1912398092667928887).

So, I tried to build some of the features I use in the translator from scratch.

However, if [openai-translator](https://github.com/openai-translator/openai-translator) becomes active again, I'll switch back to it ❤️
